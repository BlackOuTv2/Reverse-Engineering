# 🔐 Android Reverse Engineering & Cracking – 90 Day Practice Plan

> A 90-day structured roadmap to learn Android app cracking, `.so` binary analysis, Frida scripting, and C-based native code understanding — from absolute basics.

---

## 📘 What You'll Learn (From Scratch)

### 📱 Android Basics:
- Android app structure (APK, DEX, Manifest)
- Activities, permissions, UI basics
- Building, signing, modifying APKs

### 🔍 APK Reverse Engineering:
- Decompile APK using `apktool`, `jadx`
- Edit Smali code (login patch, bypass logic)
- Rebuild + sign cracked APKs

### ⚙️ Native Code + `.so` Files:
- Write C code and compile to `.so`
- Understand ELF file format
- Reverse `.so` using IDA/Ghidra
- Analyze native login / key validation logic

### 🧪 Frida Scripting:
- Hook Java methods (bypass login, token dump)
- Hook native `.so` functions
- Dump memory, modify return values at runtime

### 🛠 Real-World Practice:
- Crack login, OTP, license, root-check in test apps
- Bypass in-app purchases or encryption logic
- Full crack chain from APK to native libs

---

## 🧩 Tools Used:
- Android Studio, Emulator / adb
- apktool, jadx, smali
- Frida + Python
- IDA Free / Ghidra
- C / gcc / ndk-build

---

## 🚀 Goal:
> Become confident in analyzing, modifying, and bypassing Android app protections — both Java and native level — using real tools and techniques.

---

## 📁 Daily Practice Folders:
Each folder contains:
- Code (C / APK / Smali)
- Notes / Writeup
- Frida scripts
